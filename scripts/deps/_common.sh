# Shared helpers for scripts/deps/<name>.sh. Sourced, not executed.
#
# Same contract as CPSL_ROS2_Sensors/scripts/deps/_common.sh, kept in step with
# it on purpose: console runs both repos' scripts the same way.
#
# The contract every deps script keeps:
#   - system dependencies only (apt packages, SDKs built under /opt and
#     installed to /usr/local). Nothing in the workspace, the user's shell rc,
#     the static IP on the robot subnet or chrony -- scripts/bootstrap_host.sh owns
#     those.
#   - run as root, no sudo inside: the Dockerfile and a container run it
#     directly; on a host, run it with `sudo bash`.
#   - idempotent and quick when already satisfied, so a container can re-run
#     it on every start.
#   - a non-zero exit means the dependencies are NOT in place.
